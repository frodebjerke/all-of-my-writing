When I write stuff, I might include it in this repo. Should hopefully include a gh-pages in not a too far distant future

## About the folders

#### Microx
This one is about Microservices. I've worked with this kind of architecture to some extend. Additionally, I have participated on conferences like microxchg where they exclusively talk about it.

Its nothing really new microservices, just old tweaked to something I think is right for computing looking at the current trends with all the devopsy stuff.

As Chad Fowler said however: Microservices will teach us what we did wrong with monoliths and someday in the future we will all meet at monolith conf.
